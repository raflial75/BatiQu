    'batik-bali': "Batik made its way to the island of Bali in 1970, brought by Pande Ketut Krisna from Banjar Tegeha, Batubulan village, Sukawati Gianyar Bali. Interestingly, the first Balinese batik was not hand-drawn but rather block-printed using a traditional weaving tool, not a machine. Originally, batik cloth served as a head wrap for Balinese men but evolved into versatile fabric suitable for various activities. Bali is a hub of diverse cultural elements, encompassing textiles, Buddhist beliefs, sculptures, paintings, and other crafts. Batik in Bali extends beyond its traditional and ritualistic roots, with the motifs continuously evolving to reflect Balinese culture. Balinese batik is predominantly used in traditional ceremonies or religious events within the local community.",
    'batik-betawi': "Betawi batik began to be made in the 19th century in Batavia. It is not known who first created it, but the fashion houses Met Zellar and Van Zuylen were at that time the most popular batik producers among Batavia's upper class, Dutch, Chinese and native elites. One of the areas that still exists to produce typical Betawi Batik is Kampung Batik Betawi Terogong, Jakarta. Until the early 1960s, Terogong was just an ordinary village. But after that, this area evolved into a batik village. There are about 40 batik motifs created by the Terogong community. All of them are divided into three groups, namely icons of Jakarta, Flora, and Fauna. Initially, the motifs used in typical Betawi batik were exactly like batik from the north coast of Java Island, namely pesisiran. However, it began to develop with the influence of Chinese and Middle Eastern cultures. Betawi batik uses many bright basic colors. The patterns on the motifs also depict a lot of Betawi culture such as ondel-ondel, jali-jali dance, ciliwung river, tanjidor to ceila map. There are several types of Betawi batik motifs, each with a unique meaning. Among them, the 'Skyscraper' motif symbolizes the progress of Jakarta, featuring the iconic ondel-ondel in the middle of towering skyscrapers, which symbolizes technological progress. 'Jali-jali' commemorates the abundance of jali-jali trees in Jakarta, once popular for making children's accessories. The 'Hong Bird' motif, influenced by Chinese and Arabic culture, symbolizes happiness with its predominant red and yellow colors. 'Penganten Betawi' depicts traditional Betawi wedding attire, combining Chinese and Arabic influences. 'Nusa Kelapa Motif' depicts Jakarta's calm and lush past, while 'Rasamala' takes inspiration from the sacred Rasamala tree in Batavia. 'Penari Ngaronjeng' features a woman gracefully performing the Ngaronjeng dance. 'Kaian Bertumpal' or 'Pucuk Rebung' features a red and yellow triangular pattern on a black or blue background. The 'Loreng Ondel-Ondel' motif depicts an ondel-ondel couple complete with colorful clothes. Betawi batik usually uses bright colors such as yellow, red, green, orange, white, blue, and black, each of which represents typical traits of the Betawi people: red for dynamic learning ability, yellow for warmth and business acumen, blue for upholding customs, green for harmony, white for purity and religiosity, and black for adventurous spirit, vivid imagination, and mystery.",
    'batik-celup': "According to history, the tie-dye technique originated in China and later spread to India and the Nusantara regions. The tie-dye technique was introduced to the Nusantara by Indian traders, gaining significant attention for its beautiful decorative patterns and captivating array of colors. The use of tie-dye is prominent in various regions such as Sumatra (especially Palembang), South Kalimantan, Java, and Bali. Tie-dye batik is also known as 'batik jumputan'. In the traditional dyeing process of batik jumputan, natural dyes were initially utilized, but with the advancement of science and technology, synthetic dyes became more prevalent due to their extensive color range and simpler application processes. Nevertheless, both natural and synthetic dyes have their respective advantages. There are two techniques for creating tie-dye batik: the tie technique, where the fabric is bound in various ways to create patterns, and the stitch technique, where the fabric is patterned and stitched using a straight stitch with a strong thread to create tight folds that resist dye penetration during the dyeing process.", 
    'batik-cendrawasih': "The development of batik culture in Papua began when the Indonesian government received assistance from The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1985 to empower culture in the Eastern part of Indonesia, particularly Papua. To provide batik training in Papua, the government brought in batik trainers directly from Java, especially from Yogyakarta. After receiving batik training, batik craftsmen in Papua gradually became accustomed to batik-making, even producing their own distinctive batik motifs. Various ethnic groups in Papua have contributed to the development of diverse batik patterns, ranging from those residing in the mountains to the coastal areas. Therefore, the majority of batik motifs in Papua depict the surrounding natural conditions, including flora and fauna. The central production hub for batik in Papua is located in the Jayapura region. Typically, batik work in Papua is divided, with women engaged in batik tulis (hand-drawn batik) and men creating batik cap (stamped batik). The cendrawasih motif, often combined with depictions of plants and beautiful Papua-specific flowers, is prominent. Featuring the distinctive and beautiful feathers and tail of the cendrawasih bird, this motif is characterized by hues of green, red, and golden yellow. Batik adorned with the majestic cendrawasih bird imparts a sense of strength and grace to the wearer, offering an elegant appearance with its captivating designs and colors.",
    'batik-ceplok': "Batik ceplok, also known as ceplokan, is a type of batik characterized by geometric patterns or motifs, such as squares, ovals, or stars arranged in a circular fashion, resembling a flower with symmetrical patterns. This design is inspired by the kawung fruit or split areca nut. The variations in batik ceplok are diverse, with the main geometric shapes filled with other batik motifs such as kawung, parang klithik, truntum, or additional embellishments like flowers and gerdo (garuda). The ceplok batik motif symbolizes the fate and orderliness of life, emphasizing that there are rules and lines in the world's existence. It is believed that those who wear this batik can lead a disciplined life. In the past, batik ceplok was worn by government officials, intending to instill a sense of duty and honesty in their tasks. There are several types of batik ceplok, each with its own significance. Batik Ceplok Kawung symbolizes perfection, Batik Ceplok Kesatrian represents sincerity, patience, and courage in navigating the predetermined path of life, Batik Ceplok Sriwedari signifies coolness and inner peace for the wearer and family, and Batik Truntum embodies the purity of genuine affection. From a philosophical perspective, batik ceplok reflects the destiny and orderliness of life, illustrating that there are rules and boundaries in the world. It is expected that those who wear it will lead an organized and honest life. Batik ceplok also serves as a symbol of harmony, balance, and perfection, with symbols not only related to human life but also to the entire universe.",
    'batik-ciamis': "The batik culture in Ciamis began to flourish after the Diponegoro War in the nineteenth century. During this time, many forces led by Prince Diponegoro left Yogyakarta to travel to Batavia for the war against Dutch colonialism, with Ciamis being one of the routes taken by the procession. In brief, after the war concluded, the troops eventually settled in Ciamis, and those skilled in batik revitalized the batik-making as a daily occupation. Around the twentieth century, batik-making in Ciamis gradually evolved into a mass-produced product accessible to people outside the Ciamis region. The heyday of Ciamis batik lasted from the 1960s to the early 1980s when it could compete with Solo, Yogyakarta, and Pekalongan batik. However, in the 1980s, the competitiveness of Ciamis batik weakened due to unfavorable macroeconomic changes for Ciamis batik artisans, exacerbated by the eruption of Mount Galunggung in 1982, causing almost a year of obscured sunlight due to volcanic ash covering the Ciamis sky. Consequently, artisans struggled to properly sun-dry their batik products. Initially limited to two colors, soga brown and black with a white background, Ciamis batik later diversified its color palette due to assimilation with coastal batik and the expanding availability of natural dyes. Ciamis batik motifs are distinct, characterized by simplicity and often referred to as Ciamisan batik, representing the natural beauty of the city. Ciamisan batik motifs frequently feature inclined stripes resembling cliffs, providing a visual parallel to Javanese parang batik. Other motifs include kumali batik with four surrounding forms encircling the core and cupat manggu, with geometric patterns depicting mangosteen fruit. Despite its simplicity, Ciamis batik motifs indirectly connect to the historical cultural ornamental diversity of coastal batik, such as Tasikmalaya, Garut, Indramayu, and Cirebon. Additionally, influences from inland batik (Solo and Yogyakarta) contribute to forming a composition and color character for Ciamisan batik motifs. The fusion of coastal and inland influences creates a new batik culture, giving birth to various Ciamisan batik motifs, aligning with the local community's preference for simplicity blended with contemporary elements, often referred to as 'batik sarian.' Ciamis batik motifs lack symbolic meanings, philosophies, or indications of specific social status. The creation process emphasizes simplicity inspired by the surrounding environment. Notable Ciamis batik motifs include rereng lasem, rereng seno, parang sontak, rereng sintung ageung, lepaan, kopi pecah, rereng parang rusak, kumeli, rereng adu manis, rereng parang alit, rereng jenggot, rereng useup, and rereng peuteuy papangkah.",
    'batik-garutan': "Batik Garutan has its roots in the Dutch colonial era in Indonesia when skill enhancement programs were introduced to boost the local economy, particularly in Garutan Village, East Java. Initially crafting simple patterns with dark colors, the transformation of Batik Garutan began in the 1920s under the innovation of Mas Bokiran, a skilled craftsman. Incorporating bright colors and elegant yet straightforward designs inspired by the surrounding nature of Garutan Village, including flowers, leaves, and birds, Mas Bokiran revitalized the batik tradition. His teachings to subsequent generations ensured the continued evolution of batik-making as a primary activity for Garutan villagers. Over time, Batik Garutan gained recognition and popularity, earning accolades at the National Batik Week in 1978. Today, batik craftsmen in Garutan Village maintain the authenticity of the tradition, employing traditional techniques using wax and canting. While rooted in tradition, they continually innovate Batik Garutan patterns and colors to align with contemporary trends, producing captivating and beautiful designs. The patterns often depict recognizable flora and fauna from the village environment, with vibrant colors harmoniously blended to create distinct and meaningful batik art.",
    'batik-gentongan': "Madura batik has a rich history rooted in the Pamelingan kingdom in Pamekasan, Madura, particularly during the 16th and 17th centuries. Notably, the influence of figures like Raden Azhar and the Duke of Sumenep, Arya Wiraraja, played crucial roles in introducing and developing Madura batik. The coastal and inland batik styles feature diverse motifs inspired by animals, plants, and creative combinations, each carrying a unique story depicting the daily life of the Madurese people. Characterized by prominent lines, Madura batik incorporates bold and assertive colors, with red symbolizing strength, green representing religious significance, yellow symbolizing rice grains, and blue depicting the surrounding sea. The patterns showcase the livelihood of fishermen and marine life, reflecting the predominant occupation in Bangkalan. Popular motifs such as Tong Centong and Carcena carry deeper meanings, and Bangkalan's batik collection boasts over a thousand motifs, each uniquely named in the local dialect. The batik tradition in Madura, evolving from historical roots, remains vibrant with a diverse array of motifs, reflecting the cultural richness and creativity of the Madurese people.",
    'batik-kawung': "Batik Kawung, an ancient hand-drawn batik motif, boasts a long and intricate history. Characterized by repetitive geometric patterns, it comprises circular motifs resembling roses or stars, as observed in the ancient Hindu temple walls like those of Candi Prambanan in Java. The motif's existence even predates the 17th century, evident in Candi Syiwa from the 9th century. During the era of the Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat Sultanate, the exclusive use of Kawung motifs was restricted to the royal family circle. Originally considered a forbidden motif, along with others like Parang, Udan Liris, Sawat, Cemukiran, Parang Rusak, Alas-alasan, and Semen, Kawung was solely permitted for those within the palace confines. Crafted meticulously and requiring considerable time, the making of Kawung batik was regarded as a form of devotion to the king. With each motif carrying significant meanings, batik served as a marker of social status during that time, from the ruler and royal family to various kingdom members, each having specific regulations for motif usage. Over time, the exclusivity of Kawung batik expanded beyond the palace, reaching diverse social strata after the division of the Mataram Kingdom into Surakarta and Yogyakarta. In Surakarta, Kawung batik was worn by the Punakawan or advisors, while in Yogyakarta, it became associated with the Sentana Dalem, individuals with connections to the royal family. However, it later gained popularity among the general public. Iconically linked to Semar, a renowned Punakawan character in traditional puppetry, Kawung-patterned batik became widespread, embodying cultural richness and creativity. Despite its simplicity, the Kawung motif holds profound philosophical meanings, symbolizing a pure heart, usefulness to others, unity, and self-control, making it a powerful and cherished element in the world of batik.",
    'batik-keraton': "Batik Keraton, crafted within royal circles with specific motifs, was historically exclusive to the palace elite. Originating from the Javanese words 'amba', meaning to write, and 'titik', meaning dot, batik refers to cloth patterns created by applying wax to resist dye penetration. Throughout the evolution of kingdoms, the arrival of traders from India, China, Arab, and later Europe, and the establishment of Islamic Mataram Kingdom leading to the creation of Keraton Yogyakarta and Keraton Surakarta, batik has reflected the eras and environments it emerged from. While Surakarta's Keraton batik has undergone various innovations, its underlying motifs remain influenced by Yogyakarta's Keraton batik. Traditional batik within the Sultanate of Yogyakarta is characterized by stark white base colors and distinct geometric patterns, some enriched with parang and nitik elements. In contrast, batik from Puro Pakualaman blends patterns from Keraton Sultanate Yogyakarta with colors from Keraton Surakarta, influenced by the close familial ties between Puro Pakualaman and Keraton Surakarta. This fusion is exemplified by the renowned Candi Baruna and Peksi Manyuro patterns from Puro Pakualaman, incorporating influences from both Surakarta and Yogyakarta, while Keraton Sultanate features well-known patterns such as Ceplok Blah Kedaton, Kawung, Tambal Nitik, Parang Barang Bintang Leider, among others. The intricate motifs and rich colors of Keraton batik showcase the cultural nuances and historical connections within Indonesia's royal traditions.",
    'batik-lasem': "The evolution of batik in Lasem is believed to have begun during the time of Na Li Ni or Princess Campa, the wife of Bi Nang Un, a member of Cheng He's expedition (1405-1433), who introduced batik techniques in the 15th century. The golden age of the batik industry established by the Chinese community in Lasem began around the 1860s. During this period, the batik trade became the most profitable enterprise after the opium trade. The diverse cultural interactions and trade in commodities along the northern coast of Java, particularly in the Lasem region, originated from various ports visited during maritime voyages. Recognizable points include the ports of Kiringan (now lost), the mouth of the Dasun River (in Dasun Village), and the Bonang port (east of Lasem City). According to C.T.H. Van Deventer, the emergence of large-scale batik production in Lasem was an unusual phenomenon led entirely by the Chinese. He referenced the Colonial Verslag of 1892, Bijlage C, No. 10, stating that Chinese batik entrepreneurs sent fabrics to batik makers in the production area (homes in Pecinan Lasem) and scattered villages. The delivery methods varied, either directly or through intermediaries. Van Deventer noted that a batik maker could receive materials for 50 to 500 fabrics, pre-weighed. After covering the fabric with wax, it was returned to the batik entrepreneur's home for coloring. The batik makers in Lasem numbered only 4,300 people, he reported, mostly women continuously engaged in batik work. By the late 19th century, batik entrepreneurs in Lasem employed male workers tasked with creating stamped batik 'tjap.' White cotton fabric was obtained from European cotton entrepreneurs, while wax came from Timor—specifically, Atapupu. Atapupu was a major port on Timor Island during the Spice Trade. The global spice traders in Timor hunted sandalwood from the 3rd century AD to the 18th century AD.",
    'mega-mendung': "The historical origin of the Megamendung batik motif is connected to the arrival of the Chinese community in the Cirebon region in the 16th century. The Muara Jati port in Cirebon served as a significant stopover for both foreign immigrants and the local population, a historical connection associated with Sunan Gunung Jati's propagation of Islam in Cirebon. During this period, Sunan Gunung Jati married a woman of Chinese descent known as Ratu Ong Tien, leading to an influx of Chinese traditions and culture into the Cirebon royal court. This cultural fusion influenced batik artists in the Cirebon palace area to incorporate Chinese cultural elements into Cirebon batik motifs, known today as Megamendung batik. Although there are similarities in the symbolic representation of clouds in Chinese tradition and Megamendung batik, the cloud motifs in Megamendung are distinct with their linear, pointed, and triangular shapes compared to the round clouds in Chinese tradition. Megamendung batik holds unique meanings and philosophies for its wearers. Initially dominated by blue with interspersed red, symbolizing masculinity and a dynamic atmosphere, these colors are also associated with the straightforward, open, and egalitarian nature of coastal communities. Blue represents the vast, calm, friendly sky, symbolizing rain that brings fertility and life. The Megamendung motif is believed to convey a sense of grandeur and authority while providing a calming and soothing presence. Its meanings include pleasantness, the restraint of anger, and the depiction of a limitless sky as a symbol of freedom without boundaries. The intricate cloud patterns also symbolize maintaining composure even in challenging situations, akin to the calming and soothing effect of clouds. The blue sky signifies vastness, serenity, and anticipation of much-awaited rain, bringing fertility and life.",
    'batik-parang': "The Parang batik motif, originating between 1586-1601 and attributed to Panembahan Senopati, the Sultan of Islamic Mataram, has a fascinating legend associated with its creation. Panembahan Senopati, a king known for his meditations along the Parangtritis to Pangandaran beaches, encountered Nyi Roro Kidul, also known as Dewi Ratna Suwida, during these contemplative sessions. Inspired by the tumultuous waves of the South Sea hitting the rocks, Panembahan Senopati created the Parang motif. Initially named 'parang', a term for a sharp weapon, it later derived from 'pereng', meaning a sloping or tilted slope. The Parang batik motif carries significant meanings, representing the challenges in life that, when faced with patience and wisdom, lead to resilience. Additionally, it symbolizes a leader's struggle akin to navigating a whirlpool, with success metaphorically compared to finding a gem. The motif's deformation from an eagle shape further signifies intelligence, leadership example, physical strength, and the ability for activity and mobility.",
    'batik-pekalongan': "The art of batik originated within courtly traditions before extending to the coastal communities of northern Java, including Pekalongan, believed to occur during the periods of Demak, Pajang, and Mataram Islam. Pekalongan's batik evolution was notably influenced by the Cirebon Palace, and it absorbed Chinese and Arab cultural influences, particularly from the Arab village in Pekalongan and Chinese immigrants since the 16th century. Early Pekalongan batik also bore traces of Mataram Islam patterns after the Diponegoro War. Pekalongan's role as a bustling trade city facilitated the enduring development of the batik trade during the colonial era. Distinguished by its patterns and motifs from Solo or Yogyakarta batik, Pekalongan batik showcases dynamic variations due to the diverse cultural inspirations, involving three key ethnic groups: Chinese, Arab, and indigenous communities. The convergence of these cultural elements shapes the distinctive features of Pekalongan batik, evident in motifs like pandanus stripes, peach and rose flowers, sparrows, and peacocks against a kawung pattern background.",
    'batik-priangan': "The batik narrative in the Priangan region unfolds with tales as intricate as the peacock dance adorning its batik fabrics. Stretching back in time, the batiks from Priangan, particularly Ciamis, Tasikmalaya, and Garut, weave a tapestry rich with stories of ebb and flow that never cease. The influence of Javanese migrants is inseparable from the mention of batik in Priangan. In 1825, during the Diponegoro War, a massive exodus transpired towards West Java, with Banyumas batik artisans among the refugees, leaving an indelible mark on Priangan's batik. This influence is notably seen in the background colors of Ciamis and Tasikmalaya batik (ivory yellow) and Garut batik (gumading yellow). Despite this, the Priangan community is believed to have been familiar with various batik motifs since the 12th century, as documented in the Sanghyang Siksa Kanda Ng Karesian manuscript, reflecting the Sundanese way of life during the Sunda Kingdom. This era showcased batik motifs like kembang muncang, pasi-pasi, kalangkang ayakan, poleng rengganis, jayanti, boeh siang, surat awi, ragen panganten, to boeh alus, predominantly using yellow, earthy brown, and blue from tarum trees. The downfall of the Sunda Kingdom in 1579 resulted in these motifs being largely forgotten, coinciding with the Mataram invasion (1620-1667) that imposed regulations adhered to by Priangan's regents. Priangan had to adopt Mataram batik with specific motifs. During this time, the Sundanese were required to wear Javanese-style (Mataram) batik clothing, except for the occasional use of the head covering (kuluk). The book 'Gaya Hidup Bupati-Bupati Galuh' by Yulia Sofia details the attire of Priangan regents, featuring plain black bedahan without gold embroidery, closed collars, and batik sinjang. The sinjang motifs include kawung (large and small), rereng (or lereng), udan liris, barong rusak sedang, parang teja, parang kembang, parang kusuma, parang cetung, and curiga. The resurgence of Priangan batik occurred after the monetary crisis following World War I. In the 1930s, the home-based batik industry emerged in Tasikmalaya, Ciamis, and Garut. These batiks featured new motifs or modifications of old ones (Mataraman), though not from the Pajajaran era. The distinctive feature of Garut batik was its light yellow background color, resembling ivory or gumading. Notably, the motifs included squares, kawung, and parang. According to Darpan Ariawinangun's book 'Seputar Garut', batik-making traditions have existed in the Sunda region, as mentioned in the Sanghyang Siksa Kanda Ng Karesian manuscript. The arrival of Karel Frederik Holle in the late 19th century, establishing the Waspada Tea Plantation in Cikajang, Garut, further perpetuated Garut batik. Holle provided an opportunity for locals to produce batik for daily or workwear. Batik from Garut became a souvenir for tourists in the 1920s. In Tasikmalaya, batik flourished until 1939. However, during the Japanese occupation, the situation changed drastically, with hundreds of batik businesses closing and only resurging after Indonesia's independence. The revival began with the reactivation of the Mitra Batik Cooperative, gaining momentum until the late 1950s. Unfortunately, the onslaught of modern clothing dealt a blow to Tasikmalaya's batik industry, leading to the closure of the cooperative's batik factory and the sale of extensive land. A similar fate befell other cooperative assets. In 1951, a batik crisis unfolded globally, as noted in the book 'Setengah Abad Koperasi Mitra Batik'. In Ciamis, batik thrived in the 1960s to the 1980s. Batik artisans in Ciamis, united under the Rukun Batik Cooperative, acquired various assets and established a raw material batik factory, which remains the cooperative's headquarters today. However, the influx of printed batik textiles in the 1980s led to the decline of Ciamis batik. By 1997, hundreds of batik artisans had closed shop, and today, the sole batik activity in Ciamis is carried out by the Rukun Batik Cooperative",
    'batik-sekar': "The Sekar Jagad batik motif has been known since the 18th century, signifying its presence as one of Indonesia's classic batik motifs created by the ancestors of the Indonesian people from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. It is fascinating to delve deeper into the story of how the Sejar Jagad motif came to be. Reflecting on its name, derived from the Dutch word 'kaart', meaning map, the creators of this theme had a broad perspective on the global world, not limiting their experiences to local coverage. During that time, when the Majapahit Kingdom's glory still resonated in Java, the profound works of indigenous people on the Sejar Jagad batik were open to acculturation with foreign nations. Its development was influenced not only by the Dutch but also by the cultural influence of the Chinese ethnic group, shaping this local cultural product. History recounts political turmoil in various regions of the archipelago two centuries before Indonesia gained independence. The Sejar Jagad tie-dye motif conveys messages about the local wisdom of specific communities. Therefore, the heritage of the ancestors, including the Sejar Jagad batik, must be preserved. This style is also imbued with meanings and philosophies containing moral teachings to guide humans toward nobility.",
    'batik-sidoluhur': "The name Sido Luhur carries the meaning of hope to achieve the highest position and serve as an example for the community, known as nobility. The myth surrounding Sido Luhur batik demands the initial creator to hold their breath for an extended period. Historically, Sido Luhur batik was crafted by Ki Ageng Henis for his descendants, with Ki Ageng Selo, a grandfather of Panembahan Senopati, being the historical figure associated with its creation during the Mataram Sultanate. In the Surakarta palace, the Sido Luhur batik motif is used for the bride's entourage during wedding nights. In Javanese culture, wearing Sido Luhur batik is believed to bring prosperity and nobility to the couple's married life. The motif is also used in the mitoni ceremony or the seventh-month pregnancy ritual, symbolizing happiness and the desire for the unborn child to possess noble virtues. Additionally, Sido Luhur batik is often used to carry babies, aiming to provide joy and a sense of calmness to the infants. The profound philosophy behind wearing Sido Luhur batik is to instill happiness and tranquility in both ceremonial and daily life, reflecting the cultural values and aspirations associated with this traditional Javanese batik motif.",
    'batik-sidomukti': "The Sidomukti batik motif is a classic pattern and is said to have existed since the era of Paku Buwono IV. The Sidomukti batik motif is a modification of the Sidomulyo batik motif, which is believed to have been created since the Mataram Kartasura era. The modification involves the addition of background ukel, sawut ornaments, and cecekan elements on its inner parts.",
    'batik-sogan': "Sogan Batik is a classic patterned batik known for its traditional stripes. It is named Sogan because the dyeing process originally used natural dyes extracted from the Sogan tree wood. Classic Sogan Batik represents a tie style closely associated with the prestigious regions of Yogyakarta and Solo in Java. Typically, their motifs follow classical palace patterns. Sogan Batik from Yogyakarta is often characterized by dark brown, black, and white colors, while Solo's Sogan features light orange and brown hues. The classic colors of Sogan Batik are rich in symbolism. Explained in Serat Wirid Hidayat Jati, the golden yellow color symbolizes the palace's bird race emblem, representing flying creatures and the local color of the spiritual journey after the emergence of the Siriyah kingdom. This color pattern was known before the arrival of Islam in Java and was later revised by the Wali Songo. Initially called Soga Batik because it was dyed using natural dyes extracted from the Soga tree, its trunk having a brownish-yellow color. The meanings of colors in Batik include black symbolizing permissible worldly desires, red representing the desire for anger, yellow signifying Sufi desires, and white symbolizing peaceful or virtuous desires. Simultaneously, the brown color in Batik carries profound meanings related to Javanese traditions, emphasizing inner perspectives and cultural philosophies. Brown or chocolate colors also represent warmth, humility, kindness, togetherness, and tranquility, aligning with the Javanese preference for emotional depth in their actions. The significance of this color is deeply rooted in the rich cultural philosophy of Javanese society.",
    'batik-tambal': "Tambal batik, a unique motif distinguished from others, holds profound significance in the continuum of human existence from ancient times to the present. Representing the act of mending and repairing aspects of life, tambal batik conveys the message that individuals must continually strive for self-improvement, both physically and spiritually. Originating in the regal environment of the Yogyakarta palace, tambal batik is not only characterized by its distinct patterns but is also imbued with prayers and aspirations to the divine. Believed to aid in the healing process, the motif's arrangement of various patterns, including parang, truntum, and floral ornaments, is akin to patchwork, allowing for creative freedom in shaping squares that form the recognizable tambal batik we know today. Despite the seemingly random composition, tambal batik carries profound philosophical meanings. Its diverse color palette, blending dark and bright hues, accentuates the intricate details of the constituent motifs. Evolving from traditional fabric sheets, tambal batik has transcended its medicinal origins, finding expression in various forms such as shirts, dresses, blouses, and bags, making it a versatile choice for both everyday and formal wear."
